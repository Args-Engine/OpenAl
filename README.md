# C++ Audio
This repository is tracking a C++ OpenAl prototype

# Relevance
Audio is everywhere. Most of the time a slight move of anything will cause sound. Games should be no different. The same way that rendering realistic images in games helps the player to merge in the game, audio does too. For this reason even early video games had simple sound chips to produce the sound effect (think of pacman or space invaders). From then games also added background music, and these days many games even release their soundtrack as album. 
For the mentioned reason I wanted to learn how to play sounds/music in C++ and load files. 

# Legion-Engine
This reposity only tracks small parts of my implementation of sound. The Legion-Engine, a C++ game engine, has more implementation of OpenAl and audio file loading. The Legion-Engine can be found through: [Legion-Engine](https://github.com/legion-engine/legion-engine)
